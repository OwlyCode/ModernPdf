The PHP 5.3, PSR Compliant, Pdf Generator

Still in early development. More to come in the future ...

Todo before it's usable :
-------------------------

- [ ] Proper low-level stream handling.
- [ ] FileRepresentation refactor.
- [ ] Ensure the generated PDF is valid
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] High level APIs.
